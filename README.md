### PNW Hops Data

I have appended [hops yields](https://github.com/dalloyd1/PNW-Hops/blob/main/Hops_Data_HGA.md) compiled by the Hop Growers of America (HGA) organization to the data obtained via NASS, with validation. 

To develop more granular climatic and air quality data specialized to hops, I attempted to identify hop growing counties in the PNW from two sources.
First, I used the [NASS census data](https://github.com/dalloyd1/PNW-Hops/blob/main/Hops_Counties_NASS.md) to select counties. NASS annual survey data is reported only at state level, and does not help us associate yields with counties. I also utilized the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) to search for concentrations of [hop cropland assignments](https://github.com/dalloyd1/PNW-Hops/blob/main/Hops_Counties_CDL.md) by county, and compared the results to those from the NASS census.
